# Team Weekly Report #2

**Team**: HardHatRacoons (Construction Blueprint)

**Week**: 5

**Members**: Emmie Teng, Stella Yang, Lucy Zhang, Michael McCarthy, Christopher Kelley 


## Status Report
The team has made great steps in the beginning work for the frontend and backend. The frontend navigation and routing has been set up and the initial styling has been completed for the pages. The backend clustering blueprint analysis algorithm has been created and tested to some completion. Some general housekeeping has also been done, like setting up the storyboard and doing more prototyping. The frontend faced a challenge with newly updated libraries being incompatible, leading to one library being dropped from the tech stack. 

The team plans to look into deploying the frontend and backend next week. The team also plans to refine the algorithms currently being tested. The team also wants to add more functionality to the frontend if time allows. We want to incorporate more testing throughout the development process and not a requirement at the end.
