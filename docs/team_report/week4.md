# Team Weekly Report #1

**Team**: HardHatRacoons (Construction Blueprint)

**Week**: 4

**Members**: Emmie Teng, Stella Yang, Lucy Zhang, Michael McCarthy, Christopher Kelley 


## Status Report

The team has completed multiple sections of the capstone report, including introduction, project management, requirements, and design exploration. The team has done some introductory lofi drafting of prospective UI designs and gathered user feedback during pilot studies. The team has experienced one meeting with the sponsors and is planning the next to present the mockups. The team has found developing user stories to be difficult as the algorithm is mainly focused on a singular task/goal. 
The team plans to meet again with the sponsors next week and complete a final drafting of the UI/UX. The team also plans to foster understanding of the current codebase and receive supplementary material from the sponsors.

| **Understanding of the project and the scope** | We learned more in depth about what the sponsors were looking for in our project                                     | We need to put it into our own more realistic scope and encapsulate it into a unit so that it can be done as a singular project. |
