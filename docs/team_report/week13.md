# Team Weekly Report #10

**Team**: HardHatRacoons (Construction Blueprint)

**Week**: 13

**Members**: Emmie Teng, Stella Yang, Lucy Zhang, Michael McCarthy, Christopher Kelley

## Status Report

This past week, the team has made strong progress across several fronts as we near the end of the project. We completed the Evaluation Observation Plan and are halfway through conducting user evaluations, with 10 out of 20 completed. The poster for the final presentation is in its final draft phase, with only minor visual tweaks left before printing. Emmie has finished printing the stickers and is now working on cutting them. One of the technical backend tasks — handling PDFs with excess shading — has been dropped as the team is satisfied with the current processing speed.

In response to recent class feedback, we revised our poster to contain fewer words, enlarged text for readability, and replaced certain visuals with more informative UML diagrams. We also began incorporating initial evaluation results into the design.

Looking ahead, the team will finish the remaining evaluations, print the poster by Wednesday, and update the Capstone Report with results and evaluation sections. Emmie and Lucy will finish cutting the remaining stickers, while Chris and Michael will prepare the algorithm handoff for our sponsors and explore further runtime optimizations. Lastly, Stella will be revising our Poster. As a team, we will be working on conducting more user studies in class and outside of class.

| Class     | Poster should have less words, more pictures | We shortened our poster's word coutn and made them slightly bigger. Added more UML diagrams to replace a blueprint image. Also populated our evaluation results |

### Are any resources needed? If so, what?

Funds for stickers... Currently spent $13 on sticker paper. Potentially access to a sticker cutting machine?
