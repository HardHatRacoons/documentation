### How is the team doing with communication?
We have been very active and quick to respond on Discord. We communicate our upcoming big things to care about ahead of time and coordinate the change of workload if there is ever the need for the case. The team lead continues to keep the team updating the scrum board so that we can have accurate reports and outlook towards the workload remaining. 
 

###  How is the team doing with time? 
We are actually pretty much complete on some version that we originally envisioned to hand over. There are definitely things that we could still polish up. But we are looking to talk to our sponsors tomorrow to expand on our expectations and scope :)). We have a version of the annotation of the boundaries that is ready, though it still takes a long time to run, and we have the basic functionalities that their current website already has. 



## Adjustments Going Forward
