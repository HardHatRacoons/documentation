# Team Weekly Report #11

**Week**: 14

**Members**: Emmie Teng, Stella Yang, Lucy Zhang, Michael McCarthy, Christopher Kelley

## Status Report

This week marked a major milestone for our team as we successfully presented at the Capstone Expo. We finalized and printed our poster, delivered live demos, and received great feedback from judges and attendees. Everyone pitched in to get the materials ready, and the expo went smoothly overall.

On the technical side, Chris and Michael completed the final version of the algorithm and prepared it for delivery to our sponsors. Chris also made further runtime improvements. We wrapped up our user evaluations as well, with the whole team helping out. Feedback included suggestions for better loading indicators, more consistent metric colors, and remembering page states—some of which we hope to implement in the final stretch.

We’ve started revising our capstone report, especially to include evaluation findings, and we’re continuing to refine it. Emmie has also been working on our custom stickers—we’ve finished printing and are now cutting them out.

Next week, our focus will be on finalizing the report, presentation slides, and demo video, as well as completing any last tweaks to the frontend. We’ll also be organizing our documentation and submitting our EPS poster. We’re almost at the finish line and ready to deliver a polished final product.
