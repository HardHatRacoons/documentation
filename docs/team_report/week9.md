# Team Weekly Report #6

**Team**: HardHatRacoons (Construction Blueprint)

**Week**: 9

**Members**: Emmie Teng, Stella Yang, Lucy Zhang, Michael McCarthy, Christopher Kelley

## Status Report

The team made substantial progress last week. We finished some big user stories tasks such as implementing a delete file button, converting documents to markdown, documenting the current frontend, successfully loading CSV data into a table view, and improving the clustering algorithm's speed. Testing for the table view and general testing enhancements were also completed, alongside resolving a bug in the convex hull algorithm. The team is currently still advancing towards completing the project's core functionalities.

We are still working on some tasks that we thought we were going to finish earlier, such as the implementation of thumbnail images for cards and the convex hull padding. Additionally, edge case considerations for both page and cluster identification are currently still in progress, indicating ongoing complexity in ensuring robust algorithm performance. We're als making steady progress towards Python coverage report is also underway to get us more insights on improving our run time.
