### How is the team doing with communication?
Daily communication and everyone picks up tasks relatively evenly as they come up. There hasn't been the issue of stepping on each other's toes or overlap of responsibilities.

###  How is the team doing with time? 
The team is on track to finish the project. We have been able to finish nearly all of our planned tasks each sprint. We currently already have the meat of our project complete, the last sprint will be mainly focusing on further improving our algorithmn and frontend usability.

## Adjustments Going Forward

### Keep Doing
- Keeping coverage at 100% in the web app with every PR
- Keep giving it our all to our stories
- Maintain good communication
- Showing up to all the class on time
- Showing up to sponsor meeting on time

### Start Doing
- Good documentation for web applications

- Plan out user studies completely for the rest of the project

### Stop Doing
- Feeling reluctant to communicate with sponsors
- Waiting on sponsor to provide us with their algorithm
