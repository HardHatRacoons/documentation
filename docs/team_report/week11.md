# Team Weekly Report #8

**Team**: HardHatRacoons (Construction Blueprint)

**Week**: 11

**Members**: Emmie Teng, Stella Yang, Lucy Zhang, Michael McCarthy, Christopher Kelley

## Status Report

The team has worked on a number of tasks this week. In the backend, we have worked on integrating the algorithm, improving coverage, and mocking the API from the sponsors. The frontend has worked on making the website prettier and adding darkmode styling. We ran into some roadblocks finishing the work this week as we were all extremely busy. Our plan for next week is to finish more of the tasks from last week. We may also have to remove some tasks if they feel too much.
