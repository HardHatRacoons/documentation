# Team Weekly Report #3

**Team**: HardHatRacoons (Construction Blueprint)

**Week**: 6

**Members**: Emmie Teng, Stella Yang, Lucy Zhang, Michael McCarthy, Christopher Kelley 


## Status Report

Last week, the team made strong progress in both frontend and backend development. The application was successfully deployed via AWS Amplify, and key algorithmic improvements were completed, including refining the line segment distance algorithm and cluster bounding box calculations. Backend development focused on AWS Lambda preparation and improving blueprint cluster identification, while the frontend team worked on setting up a file system, implementing PDF rendering with annotations, and initiating React tests. Documentation and sprint backlog updates were also completed.

This week, the team aims to improve page and cluster identification algorithms, complete backend documentation, and set up essential infrastructure like a bucket and database. The frontend team will implement file upload and display features, while additional mock graphs and tables will be created for the metric and table views. Lastly, task management in Taiga will be updated to keep the sprint on track.
