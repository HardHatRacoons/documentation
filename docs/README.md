# Documentation Repository <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This repository contains our documentation platform generated with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) as well as some written documents that will be populated throughout the semester.

For more information about how to setup docsify, visit [this link](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart)

Before running the docsify site, make sure you have installed all the dependency with `npm i docsify-cli -g -complete`

Then you can run docsify with `docsify serve docs`
