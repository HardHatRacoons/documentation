*Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week.*


### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
The sponsors said they wanted "every area that has a steel beam that is labelled with a label they gave us", but when following that exactly, there are a few extra pages that we identify that aren't identified in their examples. To solve this, we plan to identify all pages that contain steel with the labels they mention, see how it runs, and confirm with the sponsors if we got what they wanted.


### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
We are on target to complete the project on time, but this sprint might not be fully finished.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
We are working well together.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
RegEx is a good way to reduce runtime instead of manually searching each page using their list of labels.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Stella was the most awesome team member this week for her consistent work and assistance with solving the problems that Lucy ran into with her local development software.


## Plans for Next Week
