### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
I had trouble setting up unhappy tests to run error catching sections. I finally figured out how to do it. I also ran into some issues with mocking that I was able to fix, and authentication too.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
The project is on track.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
The team is functioning well.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I developed my vitest/rtl skills further and learned more about mocking.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
The most awesome team member this week is tied between Emmie and Stella. Emmie made a really pretty file upload and Stella finished authentication/route protecting/routing. Emmie also helped with auth!

## Plans for Next Week
