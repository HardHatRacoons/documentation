### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
We are on target to complete the project on time.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
We are working well together.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
One idea I had this week was a way to reduce text pages and remove them from being annotated. I did this by calculating what percentage of the page was covered by text boxes.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Michael with his impressive work in reducing the algorthm runtime.
