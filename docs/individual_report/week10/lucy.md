### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
I was having difficulty generating the graphs because the documentation feels sparse. However, I was able to figure it out. Some of the tests were also annoying to write, but I eventually got them done and Stella helped.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
I think we are on track.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
The team is functioning well.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I used d3 to generate graphs for the first time! It was pretty cool.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
My most awesome team member was Stella; she was super busy this week but still helped me a little with testing and set up a large part of the presentations.

## Plans for Next Week
