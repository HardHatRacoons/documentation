### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
I was having difficulty with using localstorage to track darkmode and pulling system preferences for darkmode. I was able to figure it out though; it first checks if a preference has been set, before pulling system preference, before defaulting to light. This allows it to always be what the user wants! 

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
I think we are on track.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
The team is functioning well.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I haven't really worked with classes in tailwind so that was a fun experiment to develop my skills.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
My most awesome team member was Emmie; we worked together to make some webpages prettier and create darkmode.

## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*
I will add the requested graphs and help more with darkmode/prettification.
