### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

Lack of motivation at the beginning of the sprint now that we are at the end of the project with not too many tasks left to do.
I started doing a little bit of work at a time to get back into the groove :>. We did run across an issue with setting up a test deployment on amplify, but we were able to solve it as a team after some time of troubleshooting and following the documentation we left behind for our future selves :D.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

We are nearly done with our project, pretty much only thing left is adding in an admin view and having backend be fully integrated in our AWS lambda functions.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

Team functioning great as always! Communication happening daily and everyone feels comfortable asking for help.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

- Learned more about color theory and what colors look good together
- Sharpened my frontend development skills with giving our site a facelift.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Chris for doing what our sponsors promised us but did not give us!
