### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

We had limited time for working on the project due to hosting other events and upcoming major exams, so we had to cut out some features that we had planned to implement. We looked at the the product backlog and nuked some features that did not add too much to the user experience such as different user views.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

We are done with all our core features and have a nice looking web app that is consistently themed throughout.
