### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
Initially I planned to call the API in the backend, but AWS lambda issues strike again. But I found that Amplify's frontend component made the API call possible directly in the frontend.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
There are a couple small things that could be tweaked or improved, but we are otherwise done.
### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
Team is working well together.
