### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
Lambda makes me want to cry. Amplify has a neutered version of lambda that limits what you can do in non javascript/typescipt methots. We will be pivoting to making an API to run our algorithm.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
It will be a bit of a rush to increase test coverage, profile our code, and migrate to an API backend. But it's do-able

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
Team is working well together.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
I know have a much better understanding of lambda, its a shame that with that understanding comes the knowledge that it isnt the tool for the job.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Chris for making a mock version of our Sponsors algorithm.
