### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

I have been occupied with other things this week to not focus as much on this project. 

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

I think our progress have slowed down significantly and we are only doing final polishes. We are waiting on getting people to get responses for. 

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

I think the team is working well. 

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

Spent some time considering what makes a good usability evaluation and what questions could prompt good feedback from users. 

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Emmie took a lead on designing the new brand colors and fonts

## Plans for Next Week

_What are you going to work on this week?_
I need to move the team towards getting feedback and make actionable tasks out of that feedback.
