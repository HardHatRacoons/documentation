### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
Searching through all matches on the page causes the runtime to increase by a factor of around 3. My plan to fix this is to find a way to reduce runtime by searching through a specific area of the page instead of every part of the page.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 
We are on target to complete the project on time.


### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
We are working well together.


### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?
Search via box around each line instead of via distance.


### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?
Michael for his work on integrating front-end and back-end.
