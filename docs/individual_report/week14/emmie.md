### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?
Trying to figure out what information is important to keep on our poster because there was a lot of information and not enough space.
We later cut down some the wordy words and slimed down paragraphs to bullet points.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?
Project is complete, backend is working on last minute edits to surgically insert the sponsor's algorithmn into ours.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?
Doing great as always. We did an escape room called "[Sherlock Adventure!](https://www-1551q.bookeo.com/bookeo/b_escaperoombcs_start.html?ctlsrc2=YP3gCl504AfjCvUX8r1qsJ892SPS80piVsnD+N2wW4o%3D&src=02a&type=415517HNN4E16838E577B7)" this past weekend with Escape BCS and escaped with over 20 minutes left!
