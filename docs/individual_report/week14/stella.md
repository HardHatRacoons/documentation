### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

Not really any problems at this stage of the project. I think our capstone report is now increasingly out of date as we received more and more feedback from our instructors, sponsors, and classmates and we should look to updating it. 

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

I think we have done a great job, and we can finish off strong with a clear plan ahead to make updates to usability feedback we have received as well as the executable binary that has finally been provided to us by our sponsor. 

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is working well together and we are all ready to be done

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

It was quite insightful seeing the way that other people saw our product in a way that none of us has ever seen. It provided a fresh perspective and we are making more interactions on the app easier to use. 

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Chris and Michael did a great job presenting at the CS Expo

## Plans for Next Week

_What are you going to work on this week?_
I'm trying to stay on top of all the items due (mostly from work done across the whole semester) and then help on working on front end to fix feedback from usability evaluations.
